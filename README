WikiMapper

http://xkcd.com/214/

This happens to us all.  WikiMapper is a simple hacktempt at providing insight
into those "Three Hours of Fascinated Clicking."  It is curious how one can get
from page to page on Wikipedia -- WikiMapper tries to explain it.

Usage:

install wiki_mapper.user.js into greasemonkey
ruby wiki_log.rb

when you want output, go to http://localhost:9999/?exit=1

there will now be a file called wiki_map.dot and it can be abused in the usual
ways.
